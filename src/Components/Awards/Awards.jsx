                <p>Four awards will be presented during the valedictory ceremony to researchers under the age of 35 who demonstrate excellent scientific work. The researcher should complete the work with maximum three authors. If an author wishes to be considered for the "Young Researcher Award", they should indicate at the top of the Abstract by writing "PAPER FOR THE YOUNG RESEARCHER AWARD." The author of the winning paper must personally present the work during the conference's award session. The award session will be conducted only if a sufficient number of papers are submitted to support the award nomination. Apart from the medal, recipients will get complimentary registration to the subsequent conference.
